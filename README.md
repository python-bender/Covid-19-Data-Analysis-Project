# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project ðŸ¦ ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Covid-19 pandemic data** using Python.  
The aim is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, uncover patterns, and generate insights about the spread of Covid-19, recoveries, deaths, and vaccination status.  

Even though the dataset is a bit dated, it remains highly relevant for understanding data analysis workflows and extracting meaningful insights from real-world datasets.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
